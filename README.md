# Project Ignite 2019 Machine Learning Groceries App

This app uses a mobile camera in order to recognize photos of essential food items, such as an apple or banana. The user can take photos of the food in order to add said photos to a grocery list app. ML Groceries was presented to the Project Ignite fair in April 28, 2019 and currently runs on an older version of CoreML.

*Refining the app is still in the works*
